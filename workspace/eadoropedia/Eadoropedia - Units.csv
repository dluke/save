No one has ever figured out the secret of their creation, which is jealously guarded by elven craftsmen. Elves feel at home in the woods. They effortlessly find convenient paths, and sometimes it seems that even the trees themselves protect elven archers. The elves' main disadvantage is their vulnerability in melee. Graceful and slender, elves are somewhat vulnerable, so it's best not to let the enemy engage them in melee combat."

Virtually helpless in melee, fairies possess natural magic that enables them to strike enemies from a distance. The more skilled fairies can use their sorcery to heal the wounded.

Quite a few mages have started to create whole skeletal armies, finding potential soldiers in underground catacombs and ancient battlefields.  A skeleton is a fragile unit, but is not that easy to destroy. Weak blows deal no lasting damage to their bones, and their lack of flesh gives them great protection against arrows. Like any other animated undead creature, skeletons know no pain or fatigue and have no morale. They are but a tool controlled by the mage who created them.

Even though an imp's power is only enough for no more than one lightning shot, that is poor consolation for the one being hit with it.  Demonologists use special spells to control the destructive power of these Chaos spawns, and the imps will destroy whatever their new master orders them to. However, it's hard to maintain control over a Chaos spawn for a longer period of time. So, after an imp has fulfilled its task, it is usually sent back to the Underworld."

People named them «executioners» for that, and that name remains to this day. When the empire fell, the incredibly powerful ragkhu order didn't share its fate. The executioners became professional mercenaries, offering their service to anyone willing to pay for it. An executioner is well-equipped and extremely skilled with his deadly weapon, a battle axe.

Such souls trapped between life and death are called ghosts. They hate all living things and try to drag as many souls into the world of the dead as possible. A subtle ghost body constantly flickers, moving between two worlds - the world of the living and the world of the dead. This gives them huge resistance to physical damage - a ghost can take on a whole army by itself, if wizards are not part of it. A careful and skilled warrior however, can capture the moment when the ghost becomes material, and hit it with his normal weapon. Each killing restores the strength of the ghost and regenerates it. In case a ghost absorbs unusually large quantities of other souls, the necromancer can strengthen it, turning the ghost into a more powerful being."

Legends from the tribes describe this creature as having been sent down by the Skyfather when their people were banished from civilization. During this time, many shamans prayed for counsel and made sacrifices. One night, when a powerful shaman brought himself to the sacrificial altar, the sky lit with a bright flash as lightning struck the ground, and in the midst of that sudden natural phenomenon, the behemoth appeared. It was because of this magnificent creature's desire to defend the tribes from colonists that they were able to avoid their inevitable doom. They brought it gifts, fed it prisoners and otherwise worshiped it. It was surprising that the bloodthirsty monster didn't touch the barbarians themselves, except when some idiot inadvertently entered its lair. The behemoth is a fearful creature to those who manage to enrage it. It possesses excellent health and is literally able to tear apart any creature, thanks to its huge claws, which are hard as diamond and almost two feet in length. A kick from the behemoth can shatter a man's bones into dust. Fortunately, the monster's sheer size and lack of protection can lead to its defeat, if there are enough attackers swarming it. For a Soul Stone to be turned into a unit for a hero's party, a Blooming Lane is required."

They consider themselves smarter and more cunning than other Goblins, who didn't hone ranged skills, as they have higher odds of surviving battle, due to the distance from the enemy. Should they encounter a foe in melee, however, they instantly lose that confidence. Despite their average marksmanship, Goblin-Hunters can still provide some support in small squads of thieves - with missile cover, ambushes and raids are easier and safer, especially in swamps, where all Goblins feel at home. Hunters don't rely too much on their shooting abilities, preferring to coat their arrow tips with various poisons. The best arrows they have are made from the fallen poisonous teeth of the Ericuba."

Only born fighters are permitted to enter these rigorous trials before they can don their magnificent ironclad platemail - often forged with the rare, but resourceful mithril - and arm themselves with the sharpest weapons. In peacetime, a swordmaster continuously improves his combat skills, and in war they are used as a means to break the enemy's battle formations, turning the tide of battle. On a battlefield, swordmasters can withstand far more than the average man and can easily punch through a foe's defense. A lull in the fighting allows them to rejuvenate and treat wounds. Through intensive training, they can even run in their armor, despite the incredible difficulty. Their weapons, forged by the incomparable craftsmanship of their finest masters, can easily penetrate any armor."

Knowing full well that a pegasus is highly valued in an army, valkyries pledge themselves riding on a winged steed. As a rule, the period of such a service is not long by the standards of the valkyries - just a few years - but for mortals this is more than enough, and military commanders gladly take them in. In battle, valkyries are swift with their spear strokes. In addition to melee, valkyries have mastered the art of projecting their spears directly into the hearts of their enemies without error. Unfortunately, because of the altitude, their shooting range is not very long and their ammo supply is very limited."

A runemaster dedicates his life to the study, preservation and improvement of his art and on the battlefield he is typically engaged in combat support and the repair of machines and golems. These spellcasters are often of respectable age and not often seen in the front lines of dwarven armies. They are protected by superior enchanted armor, allowing them to virtually ignore the missiles and blows of those who manage to get close enough.

No, the dwarves are not that naive. They are aware of the risk... but they don't care, believing themselves well protected by the mountain strongholds of their people. The earthshaker is vastly superior to a conventional catapult in both range and damage. By means of a complex system of levers and counterweights it is able to throw stones and metal pellets at incredible distances. The most talented rune craftsmen are needed to build an earthshaker. Enchantments are not limited to the siege engine itself. Often, even projectiles are enchanted for increased accuracy and damage. In short, the earthshaker has only one serious drawback: Due to its enormous weight it is very difficult to transport to the frontlines or move on the battlefield. It cannot move on its own and requires a fair amount of manpower to reposition."

They are more like plants than like animals. A tree that is transformed into a huorn represents an insurmountable obstacle for all flightless creatures. All attempts to cut down a huorn are quickly and ruthlessly opposed - its great strength and tirelessness allows it to fight off an entire horde of ""woodcutters"" and the hardness and inherent strength of this magical tree makes it a hard enemy to defeat."

Some of them can even be tamed. One of these monsters is the Ericuba - a swamp creature. Goblins sometimes manage to sneak an egg out of one's lair, and even get away with it, except when the angry mother catches up with the thief. When such an egg is carefully stored in a warm and damp place, a small worm soon hatches. It grows very quickly, already taller than a goblin after a few days. In battle, the Ericuba can spit out its long, needle-like, poisonous teeth, causing significant damage and maiming the victim. She has nothing to worry about - they grow back very quickly, constantly renewing themselves in this way. Its poisonous teeth can shred a man to pieces, and the ferocity of its attack shocks enemies so much they freeze in horror. If necessary, an Ericuba may devour an ally to restore its own health. Of course, Ericubas feel at home in even the most impenetrable quagmire - they like to lurk, waiting until ""dinner"" comes too close. For the egg to be turned into a unit for a hero's party it is necessary to build the Monstrologists Guild."

Given the amount of trouble they get into, many of the more experienced halflings have taken up learning how to defend themselves, despite their natural aversion to violence. The weapon of choice for the halfling rogue are short swords. As a backup, they usually carry a lead-weighted cudgel in the sleeve of their shirt. The high level of agility natural to all halflings allows them to successfully dodge most blows and arrows aimed at them. They are highly adept at finding hiding places like double bottoms in chests or coins sewn into clothes."

The equipment attached to the gryphons is forged from durable alloy steel and mithril for minimal encumbrance, making them more fierce than their naked kin. Because their vulnerable parts are covered, the strikes of their foes won't cut as deep, thus granting greater longevity.

Psions have the unnatural talent to conjure magic straight from the mind, without the need to perform any kind of spiritual practice or study. While incantations and somatic gestures are a necessity of wizards, psions skip straight to the conjuring. As a result of this skill, a psion is not hampered by the restrictions of armor and may thus protect themselves. While garbed in enchanted equipment, the psion also generates an invisible barrier around his body by his mind, making his already superb defense near impregnable. Psions are not to be underestimated in combat either. In order to defeat a Psion, one must strike its skull, and reaching its head is in itself a difficult task. Enemy mages may also find themselves at a loss when trying to subdue a psion, due to its immunity to mind-affecting spells.

Their blades, forged in dark steel and infused with powerful magic, can effortlessly cut through plate. No armor can protect its wearer from the mighty blow of these enchanted blades. Black knights are also armed with spell-like abilities, capable of reducing the overall defense of an opponent.

Like most undead servants, black knights are incapable of fear and fatigue, and can shrug off venoms and cold temperature, making an already deadly combatant a real force to be reckoned with."

For example, Darkness Cravers use extra hands of twisting darkness to assist them in weaving complex spells. These limbs are so useful that, in battle, Cravers often bestow them to particularly strong warriors. It should be noted that in order to expedite the development of their skills, Cravers are known to block part of their magical powers with a spell, forcing themselves to search for ways to use the remaining powers most efficiently. That's why in battle Darkness Cravers prefer to use spells aimed not at the enemy, but rather at their equipment or their surroundings. These spells require a lot of skill, speed and accuracy, yet little power. Sometimes Cravers even happen to invent spells that only the Darkness Chosen have the power to cast."

The first mention of these creatures dates back to the time of the Schism of Shadows, when the Drow settled in the deep, and describes nightmare incarnate: the Beholder is not just a terrifying monster - it's not even a proper being. They have the semblance of a tangle of writhing snakes or marine reptiles hanging in the air. The only thing stable about the Beholder: the colossal lidless eye hidden in writhing shadows cast by nothing. A beholder's abilities are no less strange and mysterious than its looks: it is known for certain that it's immune to magic and can use energies of magical origin to strike down the poor souls it seemingly chooses at random from a distance. As for the actual harm done, though, rare survivors name anything and everything: from hypnosis or petrification to wounding by inexistent blades, poisoning without any venom, and burning in invisible fire. It seems a Beholder uses some unpredictable magic that can take many forms thought impossible. Beholders do, apparently, have free will; the one which is evil and hostile, and strong enough to subdue those who inadvertently take a look at the central eye. They are often seen alongside Drow, but it's not certain whether Beholders serve the Drow or the Drow serve Beholders or if these creatures have arranged a mutually beneficial alliance.

Illithids now send their representatives to the Drow, where they provide certain services for them. In exchange for assisting the Drow with the surface-dweller nuisance, the Dark Elves provide live prisoners - food - to the illithids.  The common trait of the illithids, aside from a lustful hunger for brains, is the ability to subdue and dominate minds through psionic practice.

It is said that even their puppies are born with sharp claws and battle fangs. Gnoll weapons (besides their fangs) are typically makeshift spiked clubs, although given the opportunity, they prefer taking something more significant from their enemies. Armor is usually some arrangement of pelts and bones from the strongest defeated enemies. However ludicrous their weapons may be, even the weakest Gnoll is stronger than the average Human, and even mithril armor has been known to crack under their ferocious blows. They say Gnolls only become stronger as years pass, as if absorbing the power of slain enemies along with their blood. Be that as it may, Gnoll blood does contain some kind of power: Death of even the youngest Pack Warrior causes a Chaos surge, and even though the portal is usually so small and unstable that it spawns but a crippled Imp, this characteristic cannot be dismissed."

Perhaps they lack intelligence, or something mortals call a soul, or perhaps they lack empathy to understand their victim's suffering. Whatever the reason is, Gnoll Tormenters have plenty of what Demons lack.  Thinking them simply big and strong Pack Warriors is dangerously naive. Their rage is fueled by the blood of the pack, and their thirst for pain cannot be sated. While ordinary Pack Warriors would feast on their kill, the insatiable flame burning in the Tormenter's blood urges him on and on, to kill more and with ever increasing ferocity. Even other Pack Warriors rightly fear these blood-crazed maniacs, thus Tormenters always get the first pick of meat and weapons from the spoils of war. Like all Gnolls, the Tormenter's rage and incredible strength are greatly complemented by his connection to the Underworld: Whoever manages to overcome the mighty Gnoll will then face a bloodied Fiend, as they never waste an opportunity to burst into Eador through an unstable portal."

These leaders are called Tyrants, and rightfully so: Should a human ruler use even the mildest methods by which Tyrants assert their authority over the packs, he would instantly earn the eternal hatred of his subjects. The typical Gnoll is lazy, quarrelsome, bloodthirsty and small-minded, and will only obey when being forced to. That's why only an exceedingly clever and cruel Gnoll can hold the raging pack in his iron claws. The Description of Gnolls, written by an unnamed Daokon's general, accurately describes Tyrants as excessively rare Gnolls whose mind successfully hangs in the precarious balance between bestial rage and demonic cruelty. Human leaders are typically better statesmen than swordsmen, making them likely targets of assassins and furious cavalry charges, but Tyrants only become mighty warriors by overcoming the most challenging tasks at hand, in order to constantly prove their superiority to others. Aware of their own importance, they are the only Gnolls somewhat concerned for their safety, and will usually wear some kind of armor taken from a fallen enemy. Slaying a Tyrant is no small feat, but the joy of victory is abruptly cut short when the mighty Gnoll's death creates a spontaneous rift in reality, whence a Demon will emerge."

Small creatures such as demons and spawn are able to pass through the gates almost without interruption, but after devils have moved through - the most powerful servants of Chaos - it takes a very long time to restore its energy. The most monstrous creations from the bowels of hell - the Acheron - generally cannot pass through them.

At the judge's signal, the boars cheerfully rush forward, racing each other. The bolder halflings ride on the boar's back. Wild animals are no match for such ""cavalry"": The boar himself is a dangerous opponent on his own, and the rider is armed.
